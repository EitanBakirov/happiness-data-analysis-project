## Introduction

The World Happiness Report is an annual survey that ranks countries by their happiness levels. This project aims to analyze this report and explore the correlations between happiness and various statistical indicators, such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, generosity, and more.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

- Tidy the dataset.
- Create data visualizations to better understand the data.
- Perform statistical analyses, including hypothesis testing and multiple regression modeling.
- Draw meaningful conclusions from the analyses.

## Data Import and Tidying

In this section, we import the World Happiness Report data and clean it for analysis. We organize the data and ensure it's ready for further exploration.

## Visualizations

Data visualizations help us gain insights into the dataset. We use histograms, scatterplots, and other visualization techniques to understand the relationships between happiness and various factors.

## Modeling

This section includes two key analyses:

1. **Hypothesis Test - Difference in Means:** We test whether the median happiness score has increased over the years. We perform a paired t-test and present the results.

2. **Multiple Regression:** We examine the effects of explanatory variables (GDP per capita, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption) on happiness levels using a linear regression model. We discuss the model's significance and assumptions.

## Conclusion

In the conclusion, we summarize our findings and insights from the data analysis. We discuss the implications of our results and highlight the key takeaways from the project.
